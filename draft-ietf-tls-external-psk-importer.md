This document describes an interface for importing external Pre-Shared Keys (PSKs)
into TLS 1.3.

# Introduction

TLS 1.3 {{!RFC8446}} supports Pre-Shared Key (PSK) authentication, wherein PSKs
can be established via session tickets from prior connections or externally via some out-of-band
mechanism. The protocol mandates that each PSK only be used with a single hash function.
This was done to simplify protocol analysis. TLS 1.2 {{!RFC5246}}, in contrast,
has no such requirement, as a PSK may be used with any hash algorithm and the
TLS 1.2 pseudorandom function (PRF). While there is no known way in which the same
external PSK might produce related output in TLS 1.3 and prior versions, only limited
analysis has been done. Applications SHOULD provision separate PSKs for TLS 1.3 and
prior versions.

To mitigate against any interference, this document specifies a PSK Importer
interface by which external PSKs may be imported and subsequently bound to a specific
key derivation function (KDF) and hash function for use in TLS 1.3 {{!RFC8446}}
and DTLS 1.3 {{!DTLS13=I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13}}. In particular,
it describes a mechanism for differentiating external PSKs by the target KDF, (D)TLS
protocol version, and an optional context string. This process yields a set of candidate
PSKs, each of which are bound to a target KDF and protocol, that are separate from those
used in (D)TLS 1.2 and prior versions. This expands what would normally have been a single
PSK and identity into a set of PSKs and identities.

# Conventions and Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Overview

The PSK Importer interface mirrors that of the TLS Exporters interface in that
it diversifies a key based on some contextual information. In contrast to the Exporters
interface, wherein differentiation is done via an explicit label and context string,
the PSK Importer interface defined herein takes an external PSK and identity and
"imports" it into TLS, creating a set of "derived" PSKs and identities. Each of these
derived PSKs are bound a target protocol, KDF identifier, and optional context string.
Additionally, the resulting PSK binder keys are modified with a new derivation label
to prevent confusion with non-imported PSKs. Through this interface, importing external
PSKs with different identities yields distinct PSK binder keys.

Imported keys do not require negotiation for use since a client and server will not agree upon
identities if imported incorrectly. Endpoints may incrementally deploy PSK Importer support
by offering non-imported keys for TLS versions prior to TLS 1.3. Non-imported and imported PSKs
are distinct since their identities are different on the wire. See {{rollout}} for more details.

Endpoints which import external keys MUST NOT use either the external keys or the derived
keys for any other purpose. Moreover, each external PSK MUST be associated with at most
one hash function, as per the rules in Section 4.2.11 from {{!RFC8446}}.
See {{security-considerations}} for more discussion.

## Terminology {#terminology}

- External PSK (EPSK): A PSK established or provisioned out-of-band, i.e., not from a TLS
  connection, which is a tuple of (Base Key, External Identity, Hash).
- Base Key: The secret value of an EPSK.
- External Identity: A sequence of bytes used to identify an EPSK.
- Target protocol: The protocol for which a PSK is imported for use.
- Target KDF: The KDF for which a PSK is imported for use.
- Imported PSK (IPSK): A PSK derived from an EPSK, External Identity, optional context string,
  target protocol, and target KDF.
- Imported Identity: A sequence of bytes used to identify an IPSK.

# PSK Import

This section describes the PSK Importer interface and its underlying diversification
mechanism and binder key computation modification.

## External PSK Diversification

The PSK Importer interface takes as input an EPSK with External Identity `external_identity` and base key `epsk`,
as defined in {{terminology}}, along with an optional context, and transforms it into a set of PSKs
and imported identities for use in a connection based on target protocols and KDFs.
In particular, for each supported target protocol `target_protocol` and KDF `target_kdf`,
the importer constructs an ImportedIdentity structure as follows:

~~~
struct {
   opaque external_identity<1...2^16-1>;
   opaque context<0..2^16-1>;
   uint16 target_protocol;
   uint16 target_kdf;
} ImportedIdentity;
~~~

The list of ImportedIdentity.target_kdf values is maintained by IANA as described in {{IANA}}.
External PSKs MUST NOT be imported for (D)TLS 1.2 or prior versions. See {{rollout}} for discussion on
how imported PSKs for TLS 1.3 and non-imported PSKs for earlier versions co-exist for incremental
deployment.

ImportedIdentity.context MUST include the context used to derive the EPSK, if any exists.
For example, ImportedIdentity.context may include information about peer roles or identities
to mitigate Selfie-style reflection attacks {{Selfie}}. See {{mitigate-selfie}} for more details.
If the EPSK is a key derived from some other protocol or sequence of protocols,
ImportedIdentity.context MUST include a channel binding for the deriving protocols
{{!RFC5056}}. The details of this binding are protocol specific and out of scope for
this document.

ImportedIdentity.target_protocol MUST be the (D)TLS protocol version for which the
PSK is being imported. For example, TLS 1.3 {{!RFC8446}} uses 0x0304, which will
therefore also be used by QUICv1 {{!QUIC=I-D.ietf-quic-transport}}. Note that this
means future versions of TLS will increase the number of PSKs derived from an external
PSK.

Given an ImportedIdentity and corresponding EPSK with base key `epsk`, an Imported PSK
IPSK with base key `ipskx` is computed as follows:

~~~
   epskx = HKDF-Extract(0, epsk)
   ipskx = HKDF-Expand-Label(epskx, "derived psk",
                             Hash(ImportedIdentity), L)
~~~

L corresponds to the KDF output length of ImportedIdentity.target_kdf as defined in {{IANA}}.
For hash-based KDFs, such as HKDF_SHA256(0x0001), this is the length of the hash function
output, i.e., 32 octets. This is required for the IPSK to be of length suitable for supported
ciphersuites.

The identity of `ipskx` as sent on the wire is ImportedIdentity, i.e., the serialized content
of ImportedIdentity is used as the content of PskIdentity.identity in the PSK extension.
The corresponding TLS 1.3 binder key is `ipskx`.

As the maximum size of the PSK extension is 2^16 - 1 octets, an Imported Identity that exceeds 
this size is likely to cause a decoding error. Therefore, the PSK Importer interface SHOULD reject 
any ImportedIdentity that exceeds this size.

The hash function used for HKDF {{!RFC5869}} is that which is associated with the EPSK.
It is not the hash function associated with ImportedIdentity.target_kdf. If no hash function
is specified, SHA-256 {{SHA2}} MUST be used. Diversifying EPSK by ImportedIdentity.target_kdf ensures
that an IPSK is only used as input keying material to at most one KDF, thus satisfying
the requirements in {{!RFC8446}}. See {{security-considerations}} for more details.

Endpoints SHOULD generate a compatible `ipskx` for each target ciphersuite they offer.
For example, importing a key for TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 would
yield two PSKs, one for HKDF-SHA256 and another for HKDF-SHA384. In contrast, if
TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 are supported, only one
derived key is necessary.

EPSKs MAY be imported before the start of a connection if the target KDFs, protocols, and
context string(s) are known a priori. EPSKs MAY also be imported for early data use
if they are bound to protocol settings and configurations that would otherwise be
required for early data with normal (ticket-based PSK) resumption. Minimally, that
means Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation {{?RFC7301}}, QUIC transport parameters
(if used for QUIC), and any other relevant parameters that are negotiated for early data
MUST be provisioned alongside these EPSKs.

## Binder Key Derivation

To prevent confusion between imported and non-imported PSKs, imported PSKs change
the PSK binder key derivation label. In particular, the standard TLS 1.3 PSK binder
key computation is defined as follows:

~~~
           0
           |
           v
 PSK ->  HKDF-Extract = Early Secret
           |
           +-----> Derive-Secret(., "ext binder" | "res binder", "")
           |                     = binder_key
           V
~~~

Imported PSKs use the string "imp binder" rather than "ext binder" or "res binder"
when deriving `binder_key`.
This means the binder key is computed as follows:

~~~
           0
           |
           v
 PSK ->  HKDF-Extract = Early Secret
           |
           +-----> Derive-Secret(., "ext binder"
           |                      | "res binder"
           |                      | "imp binder", "")
           |                     = binder_key
           V
~~~

This new label ensures a client and server will negotiate use of an external PSK if
and only if (a) both endpoints import the PSK or (b) neither endpoint imports the
PSK. As `binder_key` is a leaf key, changing its computation does not affect any
other key.

# Deprecating Hash Functions

If a client or server wish to deprecate a hash function and no longer use it for TLS 1.3,
they remove the corresponding KDF from the set of target KDFs used for importing keys.
This does not affect the KDF operation used to derive Imported PSKs.

# Incremental Deployment {#rollout}

Recall that TLS 1.2 permits computing the TLS PRF with any hash algorithm and PSK.
Thus, an EPSK may be used with the same KDF (and underlying HMAC hash algorithm)
as TLS 1.3 with importers. However, critically, the derived PSK will not be the same since
the importer differentiates the PSK via the identity and target KDF and protocol. Thus,
PSKs imported for TLS 1.3 are distinct from those used in TLS 1.2, and thereby avoid
cross-protocol collisions. Note that this does not preclude endpoints from using
non-imported PSKs for TLS 1.2. Indeed, this is necessary for incremental deployment.
Specifically, existing applications using TLS 1.2 with non-imported PSKs can safely
enable TLS 1.3 with imported PSKs in clients and servers without interoperability risk.

# Security Considerations

The PSK Importer security goals can be roughly stated as follows: avoid PSK re-use across
KDFs while properly authenticating endpoints. When modeled as computational extractors, KDFs
assume that input keying material (IKM) is sampled from some "source" probability distribution
and that any two IKM values are chosen independently of each other {{Kraw10}}. This
source-independence requirement implies that the same IKM value cannot be used for two different
KDFs.

PSK-based authentication is functionally equivalent to session resumption in that a connection
uses existing key material to authenticate both endpoints. Following the work of
{{?BAA15=DOI.10.14722/ndss.2015.23277}}, this is a form of compound authentication. Loosely
speaking, compound authentication is the property that an execution of multiple authentication
protocols, wherein at least one is uncompromised, jointly authenticates all protocols.
Authenticating with an externally provisioned PSK, therefore, should ideally authenticate both
the TLS connection and the external provisioning process. Typically, the external provision process
produces a PSK and corresponding context from which the PSK was derived and in which it should
be used. If available, this is used as the ImportedIdentity.context value. We refer to an
external PSK without such context as "context-free".

Thus, in considering the source-independence and compound authentication requirements, the PSK
Import interface described in this document aims to achieve the following goals:

1. Externally provisioned PSKs imported into a TLS connection achieve compound authentication
of the provisioning process and connection.
2. Context-free PSKs only achieve authentication within the context of a single connection.
3. Imported PSKs are not used as IKM for two different KDFs.
4. Imported PSKs do not collide with future protocol versions and KDFs.

There is no known interference between the process for computing Imported PSKs
from an external PSK and the processing of existing external PSKs used in
(D)TLS 1.2 and below. However, only limited analysis has been done, which is an
additional reason why applications SHOULD provision separate PSKs for (D)TLS 1.3
and prior versions, even when the importer interface is used in (D)TLS 1.3.

The PSK Importer does not prevent applications from constructing non-importer PSK identities
that collide with imported PSK identities.

# Privacy Considerations

External PSK identities are typically static by design so that endpoints may use them to
lookup keying material. However, for some systems and use cases, this identity may become a
persistent tracking identifier.

# IANA Considerations {#IANA}

This specification introduces a new registry for TLS KDF identifiers, titled
"TLS KDF Identifiers", under the existing "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Parameters" heading.

The entries in the registry are:

| KDF Description    | Value  | Reference  |
|:-------------------|:-------|:-----------|
| Reserved           | 0x0000 |N/A         |
| HKDF_SHA256        | 0x0001 |{{!RFC5869}}|
| HKDF_SHA384        | 0x0002 |{{!RFC5869}}|
{: #kdf-registry title="Target KDF Registry"}

New target KDF values are allocated according to the following process:

- Values in the range 0x0000-0xfeff are assigned via Specification Required {{!RFC8126}}.
- Values in the range 0xff00-0xffff are reserved for Private Use {{!RFC8126}}.

The procedures for requesting values in the Specification Required space are specified in Section 17 of {{!RFC8447}}.

# Addressing Selfie {#mitigate-selfie}

The Selfie attack {{Selfie}} relies on a misuse of the PSK interface.
The PSK interface makes the implicit assumption that each PSK
is known only to one client and one server. If multiple clients or
multiple servers with distinct roles share a PSK, TLS only
authenticates the entire group. A node successfully authenticates
its peer as being in the group whether the peer is another node or itself.

Applications which require authenticating finer-grained roles while still
configuring a single shared PSK across all nodes can resolve this
mismatch either by exchanging roles over the TLS connection after
the handshake or by incorporating the roles of both the client and server
into the IPSK context string. For instance, if an application
identifies each node by MAC address, it could use the following context string.

~~~
  struct {
    opaque client_mac<0..2^16-1>;
    opaque server_mac<0..2^16-1>;
  } Context;
~~~

If an attacker then redirects a ClientHello intended for one node to a different
node, the receiver will compute a different context string and the handshake
will not complete.

Note that, in this scenario, there is still a single shared PSK across all nodes,
so each node must be trusted not to impersonate another node's role.
